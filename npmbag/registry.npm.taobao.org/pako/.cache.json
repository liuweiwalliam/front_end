zlib port to javascript, very fast!\n==========================================\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/pako.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/pako)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pako.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pako)\n\n__Why pako is cool:__\n\n- Almost as fast in modern JS engines as C implementation (see benchmarks).\n- Works in browsers, you can browserify any separate component.\n- Chunking support for big blobs.\n- Results are binary equal to well known [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) (now v1.2.8 ported).\n\nThis project was done to understand how fast JS can be and is it necessary to\ndevelop native C modules for CPU-intensive tasks. Enjoy the result!\n\n\n__Famous projects, using pako:__\n\n- [browserify](http://browserify.org/) (via [browserify-zlib](https://github.com/devongovett/browserify-zlib))\n- [JSZip](http://stuk.github.io/jszip/)\n- [mincer](https://github.com/nodeca/mincer)\n- [JS-Git](https://github.com/creationix/js-git) and\n  [Tedit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tedit-development-environ/ooekdijbnbbjdfjocaiflnjgoohnblgf)\n  by [@creatronix](https://github.com/creationix)\n\n\n__Benchmarks:__\n\n```\nnode v0.10.26, 1mb sample:\n\n   deflate-dankogai x 4.73 ops/sec ±0.82% (15 runs sampled)\n   deflate-gildas x 4.58 ops/sec ±2.33% (15 runs sampled)\n   deflate-imaya x 3.22 ops/sec ±3.95% (12 runs sampled)\n ! deflate-pako x 6.99 ops/sec ±0.51% (21 runs sampled)\n   deflate-pako-string x 5.89 ops/sec ±0.77% (18 runs sampled)\n   deflate-pako-untyped x 4.39 ops/sec ±1.58% (14 runs sampled)\n * deflate-zlib x 14.71 ops/sec ±4.23% (59 runs sampled)\n   inflate-dankogai x 32.16 ops/sec ±0.13% (56 runs sampled)\n   inflate-imaya x 30.35 ops/sec ±0.92% (53 runs sampled)\n ! inflate-pako x 69.89 ops/sec ±1.46% (71 runs sampled)\n   inflate-pako-string x 19.22 ops/sec ±1.86% (49 runs sampled)\n   inflate-pako-untyped x 17.19 ops/sec ±0.85% (32 runs sampled)\n * inflate-zlib x 70.03 ops/sec ±1.64% (81 runs sampled)\n\nnode v0.11.12, 1mb sample:\n\n   deflate-dankogai x 5.60 ops/sec ±0.49% (17 runs sampled)\n   deflate-gildas x 5.06 ops/sec ±6.00% (16 runs sampled)\n   deflate-imaya x 3.52 ops/sec ±3.71% (13 runs sampled)\n ! deflate-pako x 11.52 ops/sec ±0.22% (32 runs sampled)\n   deflate-pako-string x 9.53 ops/sec ±1.12% (27 runs sampled)\n   deflate-pako-untyped x 5.44 ops/sec ±0.72% (17 runs sampled)\n * deflate-zlib x 14.05 ops/sec ±3.34% (63 runs sampled)\n   inflate-dankogai x 42.19 ops/sec ±0.09% (56 runs sampled)\n   inflate-imaya x 79.68 ops/sec ±1.07% (68 runs sampled)\n ! inflate-pako x 97.52 ops/sec ±0.83% (80 runs sampled)\n   inflate-pako-string x 45.19 ops/sec ±1.69% (57 runs sampled)\n   inflate-pako-untyped x 24.35 ops/sec ±2.59% (40 runs sampled)\n * inflate-zlib x 60.32 ops/sec ±1.36% (69 runs sampled)\n```\n\nzlib's test is partialy afferted by marshling (that make sense for inflate only).\nYou can change deflate level to 0 in benchmark source, to investigate details.\nFor deflate level 6 results can be considered as correct.\n\n__Install:__\n\nnode.js:\n\n```\nnpm install pako\n```\n\nbrowser:\n\n```\nbower install pako\n```\n\n\nExample & API\n-------------\n\nFull docs - http://nodeca.github.io/pako/\n\n```javascript\nvar pako = require('pako');\n\n// Deflate\n//\nvar input = new Uint8Array();\n//... fill input data here\nvar output = pako.deflate(input);\n\n// Inflate (simple wrapper can throw exception on broken stream)\n//\nvar compressed = new Uint8Array();\n//... fill data to uncompress here\ntry {\n  var result = pako.inflate(compressed);\n} catch (err) {\n  console.log(err);\n}\n\n//\n// Alternate interface for chunking & without exceptions\n//\n\nvar inflator = new pako.Inflate();\n\ninflator.push(chunk1, false);\ninflator.push(chunk2, false);\n...\ninflator.push(chunkN, true); // true -> last chunk\n\nif (inflator.err) {\n  console.log(inflator.msg);\n}\n\nvar output = inflator.result;\n\n```\n\nSometime you can wish to work with strings. For example, to send\nbig objects as json to server. Pako detects input data type. You can\nforce output to be string with option `{ to: 'string' }`.\n\n```javascript\nvar pako = require('pako');\n\nvar test = { my: 'super', puper: [456, 567], awesome: 'pako' };\n\nvar binaryString = pako.deflate(JSON.stringify(test), { to: 'string' });\n\n//\n// Here you can do base64 encode, make xhr requests and so on.\n//\n\nvar restored = JSON.parse(pako.inflate(binaryString, { to: 'string' }));\n```\n\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nPako does not contain some specific zlib functions:\n\n- __deflate__ -  methods `deflateCopy`, `deflateBound`, `deflateParams`,\n  `deflatePending`, `deflatePrime`, `deflateTune`.\n- __inflate__ - methods `inflateCopy`, `inflateMark`,\n  `inflatePrime`, `inflateGetDictionary`, `inflateSync`, `inflateSyncPoint`, `inflateUndermine`.\n- High level inflate/deflate wrappers (classes) may not support some flush\n  modes. Those should work: Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_FINISH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH.\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n- Andrey Tupitsin [@anrd83](https://github.com/andr83)\n- Vitaly Puzrin [@puzrin](https://github.com/puzrin)\n\nPersonal thanks to:\n\n- Vyacheslav Egorov ([@mraleph](https://github.com/mraleph)) for his awesome\n  tutorials about optimising JS code for v8, [IRHydra](http://mrale.ph/irhydra/)\n  tool and his advices.\n- David Duponchel ([@dduponchel](https://github.com/dduponchel)) for help with\n  testing.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT\n","_attachments":{},"homepage":"https://github.com/nodeca/pako","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nodeca/pako/issues"},"license":"MIT","_etag":"\"79a2-17/bu0RNxqKAeYFGmBGk1w\""}
